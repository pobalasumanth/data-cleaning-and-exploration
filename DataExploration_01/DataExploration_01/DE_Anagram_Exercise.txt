In this exercise, you will divide the words of a dictionary into classes based on their length. Then, find a number of anagrams within each class for the words in the 'words.txt' file. You may imagine that there are very few anagrams that involve very long, complicated words. Whereas, there are more for short and more common words. So, your objectives for this exercise are to start with a list of words and divide it into sublists based on the length of words. Then, for each sublist, find all the anagrams. After that, count the total number of anagrams in each sublist.
